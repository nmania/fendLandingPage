Nash's Landing Page Project for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree


This is a landing page project built on top of the starter code provided as part of the coursework.
The starter project can be seen at https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page.


The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. Functionality to dynamically build the menu, to highlight the actively viewed section of the web page, and smooth scrolling to various sections, has been added via JS.
